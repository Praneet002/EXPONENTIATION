# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*

```
~~~
def fun():
    x=int(input())
    b=x
    for i in range(10):
        x=0.5*(x+b/x)
    print("Square root of the number:",x)
fun()
~~~

## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](https://github.com/Praneet002/EXPONENTIATION/blob/main/Screenshot%20(5).png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
